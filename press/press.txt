Coordinate Systems Worldwide
EPSG.io helps to discover cartographic coordinate systems used all over the world for creating maps and geodata.
With an easy to use map application it is possible to choose a location anywhere on the planet and transform coordinates between latitude & longitude (WGS84) and the selected reference system - while showing the place on a map.
Each coordinate system and transformation has a short permanent link and is exportable in various data formats (WKT, XML, OGC GML, Proj4, JavaScript, SQL).
The website is build around a powerful fulltext search indexing the official EPSG database full of detailed geodetic data from a range of sources and authorities. EPSG.io simplifies access to precise geodetic parameters for thousands of Spatial Reference Systems and Geodetic Datums, for attributes of transformations, ellipsoids, meridians, etc. It is a practical tool for anybody interested in cartography and map making.
