#Pacific Projections
Legacy and Modern Coordinate Systems for PIC

Pacific Coordinate Systems
Pacific Projections Repository is built on the EPSG.io database, which simplifies discovery of coordinate reference systems utilized all over the world for creating maps and geodata and for identifying geo-position. It is a practical tool for anybody interested in cartography and digital map making, who needs to know exact latitude and longitude values for numerical coordinates in different spatial reference systems. Included map application allows to show the precise location anywhere on the planet also visually.

The website comes with a fulltext search indexing over 6000 coordinate systems. The search starts by typing the name of the system, name of covered country, state or any of the combinations of these. Searching for EPSG and ESRI codes is supported as well.

Each coordinates system and transformation has a short permanent link and is exportable in various formats (WKT, XML, OGC GML, Proj.4, JavaScript, SQL).

The official EPSG database maintained by OGP Geomatics Committee (http://www.epsg.org/). The database comprises of very detailed geodetic parameters from a range of sources and authorities. EPSG.io simplifies access to exact parameters for thousands of spatial reference systems, transformations and conversions, datums, ellipsoids, meridians, units, etc.
